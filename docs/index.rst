**Automatic Differentiation for rigid-body-dynamics AlgorithMs**

**adam** implements a collection of algorithms for calculating rigid-body dynamics for **floating-base** robots, in mixed and body fixed representations  using:

.. create rst list with links to the following libraries

- `Jax <https://github.com/google/jax>`_
- `CasADi <https://web.casadi.org/>`_
- `PyTorch <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch>`_
- `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_


**adam** employs the automatic differentiation capabilities of these frameworks to compute, if needed, gradients, Jacobian, Hessians of rigid-body dynamics quantities. This approach enables the design of optimal control and reinforcement learning strategies in robotics.


**adam** is based on **Roy Featherstone's Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms**.
